## Python Implementation

<p>Python is an interpreted & high-level language. It is dynamically typed & is used as a general-purpose language. The default python implementation is <b>CPython</b> & is written in C programming language.</p>

<p>The CPython converts your python code into computer-readable instructions called bytecode. These instructions are interpreted by a virtual machine when you run your code. The bytecode is stored in <b>.pyc</b> file in <b>__pycache__</b> folder.</p>

<p>Other python implementations available are: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Jython:</b> compiles down to Java bytecode to run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</li>
  <li><b>IronPython:</b> compiles down to run on Microsoftâ€™s CLR (Common Language Runtime)</li>
  <li><b>PyPy:</b> uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation to translate python code into assembly language</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you want to look at CPython's bytecode then you can. Here's how you can:</p>

<p>
  Now, let's have a look at the above code. Lines 1 to 6 are a function definition. In line 8, we import the 'dis' module which can be used to view the intermediate Python bytecode (or you can say, disassembler for Python bytecode) that is generated by CPython (interpreter).
